              I was looking at exchanging my old car for a new one, I was a bit
              unsure on what car and what I should do next, but had a lady that
              was amazing, explained everything I wanted to know and was very
              patient with me, leaving as a happy customer.

              Travelled a distance to see / buy a car. There were a few things
              that needed to be sorted but the guys went out of their way to
              organise this before I left. Brilliant service üëç

              Thanks to the team for their professionalism in completing my
              recent car purchase. I bought a Mini Cooper 7 online without
              viewing it as I live 150 miles away. I viewed a detailed video and
              paid for car. When the car was delivered it was as described and I
              was more than satisfied. The whole experience was different and a
              bit worrying, out of my comfort zone, but it all turned out okay
              in the end. Thanks again.
